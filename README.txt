All the code is explained in the python file as comments.
Your data is stored in 'data/' after running save_data.py as .npy files
Model is stored in train.py
Sequence of running files:
                    1. save_data.py
                    2. train.py
                    3. predict.py
If required, commands for running the files on windows are stored in 'commands/windows/[cmd/powershell]' 
and for linux the commands are in 'commands/linux'

THIS IS SKELETON PROJECT FOR SAVING DATA, TRAINING IT AND PREDICTING OUTPUTS USING IT. 
YOU CAN USE LINEAR REGRESSION TO FIND THE PATTERN IN DATA.
